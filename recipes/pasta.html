    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy to make, customizable, mess free, one pot vegan pasta.<br>
        This was my favorite thing to make in hostel until my induction was taken away and this was my
        <a href="https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-one-pot-creamy-garlic-parmesan-pasta/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">inspiration</a>.
        I have modified it for my taste preference and ingredients available to me.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked Pasta (Macaroni, Penne, Fettucini, any kind works)</li>
        <li>4 Garlic Cloves (adjust to your liking)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Oil</li>
        <li>1 cup Soya Milk (This is the easiest to find in stores in India, homemade Cashew Milk tastes the best in
            pasta</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Nutritional Yeast</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, Turmeric, Red Chilli Powder/Flakes, Ground Black Pepper, Smoked Paprika, Peri-Peri (Start
            with less amount and adjust as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add crushed or finely chopped garlic cloves to a pan on medium heat with oil.</li>
        <li>To the pan, add a pinch of turmeric and salt and saute for about a minute (salt speeds up cooking).</li>
        <li>Add the pasta in the pan and coat it in oil then add 2 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rest of the seasoning and increase the flame to bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is to the texture of your liking and the water has reduced, add in the milk and stir</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust to your liking and it is ready to serve! It tasted great with some <a
